# Grover_Algorithm
Application of quantum algorithm on a classical computer. Grover's Algorithm is a search and find algorithm returning the highest probable match in the input's domain.

Authors:	DK Lee, Derek Dang

Class: 		GroverAlgorithm.java

Purpose:	Search a list for an element. Returns a probability of that element.

Compile:	Compile in Terminal.
			javac Driver.java

Run:		java Driver	

Input:		numQubits - the number of qubits passing in the top wire.
		    value - the special value to be found.

Output:         The probability of finding the value.

Notes:	
	1)	To search for a term, enter in the decimal value. The program
		calculates the probability using decimal values.
        2)      Remember that this is a classical program running a quantum
                program. Running time of this program is O(2^n), but the quantum
                version is O(âˆš(2^n)), which is quadratic speedup.
